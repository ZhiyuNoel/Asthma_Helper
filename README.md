## IF YOU ARE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERFACE
!! Please create your own branch firstly before doing any change.
Before create your branch, you need to change your branch to interface first, and then create branches:
```
1. git checkout interface
2. git branch <your_branch_name>
```

Then if your change is able to merge to the interface: 
1. Change the branch to interface 
```
git checkout interface
```
2. Merge the target branch to branch "interface"
```
git merge dev
```

## IF YOU ARE WORKING FOR BACKEND
!! The same, create your own branch before, but under branch backend:
```
1. git checkout backend
2. git branch <your_own_branch>
```
